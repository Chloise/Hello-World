# Hello-World
My first repository
Doing the github tutorial, am supposed to write a few words about myself so here you go: alien from planet Venus, 146 years old, (youngster from Venus planet's standards), married with 2 alien children (we call them monsters), working for the intergalactical agency, in charge of currency parity calculations among the different planets of our eco-system.

Now checking in wheter my additions to show up as diffs in version comparisons
